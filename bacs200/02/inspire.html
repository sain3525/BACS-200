        What does it mean to be an inspiration to others? For some it means
        someone that provokes others to want to do better in a particular area of their life.
        For others, it's someone has the ability and willingness to be selfless, creative,
        innovative, or courageous. When people think of heroes who contribute to society, a
        rapper wouldn't be the first thing that comes to mind due to the bad images society
        has painted of them in the past.
