            What does it mean to be an inspiration to others? For some it means 
            someone that provokes others to want to do better in a particular area of their life. 
            For others, it's someone has the ability and willingness to be selfless, creative, 
            innovative, or courageous. When people think of heroes who contribute to society, a 
            rapper wouldn't be the first thing that comes to mind due to the bad images society 
            has painted of them in the past.

            The person that has inspired has these characteristics.
        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Motivate others - people follow a great leader</li>
            <li>Big footprint - impact on millions and change the world</li>
            <li>Sacrifice & commitment - their impact usually costs them everything</li>
            <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
        </ul>
