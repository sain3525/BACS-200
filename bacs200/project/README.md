For this project I wanted to follow in the path of project 9 and build a website for a non-profit I want to support. I chose to build a website for the "Hope Alive" charity. I chose this charity because I am Haitian American and this charity was made to provide nutrition, medical and dental care and to help Haitians with job training.  I also want to build this website for this organization because, in my opinion, the current website that they have doesn't look well-put-together (hopealivesolace.org). I plan on creating a website similar to a project that I had done back in high school using weebly (braceforstereotypes.weebly.com). I plan to further enhance it using bootstrap and what I've learned in my web development course. I plan to incorporate the content that Hope Alive currently has on there website. With hope, the organization may possibly want to obtain the website from me.
